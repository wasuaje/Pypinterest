##Preparation##

To use this library, BeautifulSoup library is presumably installed:

##Get Started##

To create an instance with login credentials

    >>> from lib import pypinterest
    >>> myclient = Client('email_address', 'username', 'password')

##Board Operations##

To create a new board with a boardname and a boardcategory:

    >>> myclient.createboard('board name', 'board category')


To fetch the existed boards associated to this account:

    >>> boards = myclient.getboards()

To delete an existed board associated to this account:

    >>> boards = myclient.deleteboard('board Name')

##Pin Operations##

To post a new pin:

    >>> myclient.pin('board number', 'title', 'picture url', 'linke to a website', 'content')

To delete a pin:

    >>> myclient.deletepin('pin ID')

To search pins according to a given keyword:

    >>> myclient.searchpins('keywords with spaces', 'number of pages required, say 10')

To get all pins in a given category:

    >>> myclient.getallpins('category', 1, 10)
    
To repin a post to an existed board:

    >>> myclient.repin('board number', 'pin ID', 'content')

To like a pin:

    >>> myclient.like('pin ID')

To unlike a pin:

    >>> myclient.unlike('pin ID')

To read information from a pin:
    
    >>> myclient.readpin('pin ID')
